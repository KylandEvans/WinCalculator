Recreation of the Windows 10 calculator app in the browser


This is a basic replication of the Windows 10 built-in calculator. 

I created this from the ground up and worked on it for several days with only the Windows calculator as a style reference. 

This calculator is a mobile-friendly web based application that does basic calculations with a full built-in history and memory functions. 
The calculator also comes with all of the basic operations that you can do including sqare, squareroot, fractions, and more. 

This application was one of the first major applications that I created that was mainly JavaScript. I am very proud of this application and hope to improve on it soon and make more just like it. 

If there are any issue with it please let me know so that I can fix it imidiately.
